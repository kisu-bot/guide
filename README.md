## 📖 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Add Series to Your Wishlist

Ensure the series name matches exactly what is in Nairi (case insensitive). Your wishlist limit depends on your roles - check with server admins about role-specific limits.

```
kswa Pokemon
kswa Naruto
kswa Attack on Titan
```

### Step 2: Wait for Spawn Notifications

When someone spawns cards, you'll get messages like:

```
✨ **A card from your series wishlist has spawned!**
:one: Pokemon - @YourName
:three: Attack on Titan - @YourName
```

### Step 3: Use Collection Tools

1. Type `nc` before viewing your collection
2. React with 📝 to get all card codes on the page
3. React with ❤️ to calculate wishlist values
